# Introduction

I just had an impulse to create a program/script that can calculate the age of a GitHub user's account based on their creation date. I know that GitHub has a feature that shows the age of an account, but I wanted to create my own program/script that can do the same thing.

# How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script using `python main.py`.
4. Enter the username of the GitHub account that you want to calculate the age of.
