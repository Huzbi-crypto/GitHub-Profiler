# User Age GitHub Calculator

## Overview

I just had an impulse to create a program/script that can calculate the age of a GitHub user's account based on their creation date. I know that GitHub has a feature that shows the age of an account, but I wanted to create my own program/script that can do the same thing.

Now, I want to add more features to this program/script, such as showing the last commit date of the user and the last seen date of the user. This impulse of mine has just started, so I will add more features to this program/script in the future.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script using `python main.py`.
4. Enter the username of the GitHub account that you want to calculate the age of.

## Future plans

- [x] Add a feature of showing the last commit date of the user.
- [ ] Add a feature of showing the last seen date of the user.
